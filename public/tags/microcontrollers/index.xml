      <description>Timeline May 2018
Project Background A few weeks before my wife and I were to be apart for the summer (due to me studying abroad and her only able to join me there in the fall), my wife stumbled upon these &amp;ldquo;Long Distance Friendship Lamps.&amp;rdquo; I loved the idea, but I was less enthusiastic about the fact that the operation of the lamps depended on the continuous operation of the company servers.</description>

      <description>Timeline Aug 2017 - Sept 2017
Project Description This project began when I picked up a sad typewriter with a broken keyboard set out for free in front of the university library. Since I have a soft spot for obsolete technology, I gave it a new home. Repurposing it became a recreational exercise in both hardware-microcontroller and microcontroller-computer interfaces.
Images are broken down into lines of text by a Python script on a laptop, which then sends lines of ASCII via a serial-USB interface to an Arduino-style microcontroller.</description>
