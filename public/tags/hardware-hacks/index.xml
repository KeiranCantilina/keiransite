      <description>Timeline Feb 2017 - Current
Project Description This project was spawned by a desire to make my daily commute to class faster. Being a poor grad student, paying for a campus parking pass was out of the question. I could have bought a bike, but when I found an old 80s kick scooter on Craigslist, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the temptation to build something ridiculous.
Project Description The build is fairly simple: a brushless hubmotor+wheel rescued from a dumpster replaces the rear wheel of the scooter.</description>

      <description>Timeline Aug 2017 - Sept 2017
Project Background This project began when I picked up a sad typewriter with a broken keyboard set out for free in front of the university library. Since I have a soft spot for obsolete technology, I gave it a new home. Repurposing it became a recreational exercise in both hardware-microcontroller and microcontroller-computer interfaces.
Project Description Images are broken down into lines of text by a Python script on a laptop, which then sends lines of ASCII via a serial-USB interface to an Arduino-style microcontroller.</description>

      <title>The Scanmera</title>

      <description>Timeline Nov 2017 - Current
Project Description This project began as a just-for-fun repurposing of an obsolete scanner, but I soon discovered that the linear CCD in this scanner is very sensitive to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. This sensitivity, along with the high resolution of images produced by the Scanmera, means that I can potentially use it to measure the health of crops in fields by measuring the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is based on relative Red/IR reflectivity of plants.</description>
