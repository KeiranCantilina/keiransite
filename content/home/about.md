# About Me

I am a recent Master of Science graduate from the department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering at the University of Minnesota. My research background focuses on finding solutions to engineering problems by drawing on interdisciplinary knowledge and resources. 

I've developed a toolbox of skills that has generalist characteristics by nature and specialist characteristics by education. My problem-solving style is a hybrid between the applied tactics of engineers (“Let's make something happen”) and the experimental methods of scientists (“Let's find out how this works”). My professional research spans a variety of topics in fields ranging from molecular biology to electrical engineering. 

In my free time, I love to work on personal projects that make use of discarded electronics, broken appliances, and obsolete hardware. In the spirit of promoting upcycling, I enjoy the challenge of reusing and re-purposing materials with the smallest budget possible. This website serves as a portfolio for some of these side projects.
Outside of research, I enjoy playing the [carillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carillon), baking bread, pickling, amateur radio, and building dangerously speedy electric scooters.
