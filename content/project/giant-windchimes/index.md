# Project Description
Very large windchimes made using scrapped 6061-T6 1.5" aluminum square tubing. AutoDesk Inventor's FEA utility was used to calculate the exact dimensions required for the desired pitch, so only a single hacksaw cut was necessary for each chime without any fine-tuning afterwards.

These windchimes are designed to have EXTREMELY long sustain (>30 sec) and very quiet odd-numbered harmonics. They produce a constant hum even when there is very little wind.

The hanging ring and clapper were both prototyped in lasercut MDF; the final version used lasercut 1/4" thick transparent acrylic to give the impression that the chimes are floating in space. Transparent 50lb-test fishing line is used for the rigging to enhance the illusion.

Your neighbors will either want one or they'll hate you.
