      <description>Timeline May 2018
Project Background A few weeks before my wife and I were to be apart for the summer (due to me studying abroad and her only able to join me there in the fall), my wife stumbled upon these &amp;ldquo;Long Distance Friendship Lamps.&amp;rdquo; I loved the idea, but I was less enthusiastic about the fact that the operation of the lamps depended on the continuous operation of the company servers.</description>

      <description>Timeline July 2017
Project Background One day, my friend Dane told me about a dream he had. It was long and convoluted (as dreams often are), but the part that stuck out to me was a scene he described where I ran around a space rocket nozzle factory playing the nozzles like bells.
As a person that plays real non-dream bells semi-professionally, I became intensely curious: how exactly would it sound if I was in a rocket nozzle factory playing the nozzles like bells?</description>

      <description>Timeline Oct 2017
Project Description As an appreciator of both pretty pictures and ambitious radio projects, I wanted a real-time &amp;ldquo;Blue Marble&amp;rdquo;-style picture of the Earth as my deskop background.
My first attempt at making this happen was to try to receive the downlink from the GOES-16 geostationary weather satellite. GOES-16 is very far from the Earth, so a high-gain directional antenna is needed to listen in on it. Any reasonable person would have gotten a dish antenna, but given my time and budget constraints, I attempted to use an RTL-SDR with an inconveniently-sized corner reflector antenna built out of cardboard and foil, sized for the required gain at ~1600 Mhz.</description>

      <description>Timeline Aug 2017 - Sept 2017
Project Background This project began when I picked up a sad typewriter with a broken keyboard set out for free in front of the university library. Since I have a soft spot for obsolete technology, I gave it a new home. Repurposing it became a recreational exercise in both hardware-microcontroller and microcontroller-computer interfaces.
Project Description Images are broken down into lines of text by a Python script on a laptop, which then sends lines of ASCII via a serial-USB interface to an Arduino-style microcontroller.</description>

      <title>Contactless Water Conductivity Sensor</title>

      <description>Timeline Jan 2017 - Jun 2018
Project Description This project was for my Masters thesis at the University of Minnesota. The objective of this project was to develop a cheap and more rugged alternative to conventional water conductivity sensors, which are often susceptible to corrosion and fouling despite being quite expensive. This flaw exists because water conductivity is conventionally inferred by measuring the electrical resistivity of the water, which requires the direct contact of metallic electrodes with the water under test.</description>
