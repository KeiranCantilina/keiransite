      <description>Timeline Feb 2017 - Current
Project Description This project was spawned by a desire to make my daily commute to class faster. Being a poor grad student, paying for a campus parking pass was out of the question. I could have bought a bike, but when I found an old 80s kick scooter on Craigslist, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the temptation to build something ridiculous.
Project Description The build is fairly simple: a brushless hubmotor+wheel rescued from a dumpster replaces the rear wheel of the scooter.</description>

      <description>Timeline Aug 2017 - Sept 2017
Project Background This project began when I picked up a sad typewriter with a broken keyboard set out for free in front of the university library. Since I have a soft spot for obsolete technology, I gave it a new home. Repurposing it became a recreational exercise in both hardware-microcontroller and microcontroller-computer interfaces.
Project Description Images are broken down into lines of text by a Python script on a laptop, which then sends lines of ASCII via a serial-USB interface to an Arduino-style microcontroller.</description>
