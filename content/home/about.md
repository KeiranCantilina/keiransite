# About Me

I'm a recent Masters graduate from the University of Minnesota's department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering. My research interests center around the creative use of resources to solve interdisciplinary research problems. The research I have done in pursuit of this interest ranges from highly specialized to highly interdisciplinary. For example, I've worked on the genetic engineering of plant viruses to confer disease resistance to fruit crops, I've studied the impact of manure application methods on the microbiome of agricultural soil, and I've designed low-budget hydrological sensors that let citizen scientists monitor agricultural runoff. 

I'm comfortable learning new things (and even new fields) on the fly, and I'm passionate about working with teammates who possess vastly different knowledge- and skill-sets. Sometimes the most creative solutions come from the most unexpected perspectives.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing the [carillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carillon), baking bread, pickling, amateur radio, and building dangerously speedy electric scooters.
