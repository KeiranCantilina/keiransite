      <description>Timeline July 2017
Project Background My friend Dane emailed me one day to tell me about a dream he had. It was a long and convoluted (as dreams often are), but the part that stuck out to me was a scene he described where I ran around a space rocket nozzle factory playing the nozzles like bells.
As a person that plays real non-dream bells semi-professionally, I became intensely curious: how exactly would it sound if I was in a rocket nozzle factory playing the nozzles like bells?</description>
