&lt;p&gt;Feb 2017 - Current&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was spawned by a desire to make my daily commute to class faster. Being a poor grad student, paying for a campus parking pass was out of the question. I could have bought a bike, but when I found an old 80s kick scooter on Craigslist, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the temptation to build something ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build is fairly simple: a brushless hubmotor+wheel rescued from a dumpster replaces the rear wheel of the scooter. A cheap Chinese ebike motor controller and a trio of old NiCad drill batteries make up the power system. Paired with a handle throttle form Amazon, and I was good to go after a wee bit of hacksawing. Given that most of the parts were either found, Craigslisted on the cheap, or donated by generous well-wishing friends, this build was kept under the $50 mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 2 of this scooter replaced the drill batteries with 4 lithium-iron-phosphate battery packs very generously donated by a friend. These batteries were production prototypes of devices meant to be drop-in replacements for gel lead-acid batteries in backup applications. Unlike the old drill batteries, these are not as severely affected by the Minnesota cold, and they have a much higher energy and power density. I get 5Ah@56V with this battery arrangement, instead of &amp;lt;2Ah@48V. With the new pack, I got greatly increased range and acceleration and slightly increased top speed. Charging is accomplished using a Meanwell LED streetlight power supply (which does the constant-current regulation the batteries need to not get angry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent set of improvements added a speedometer, bell, tail lights, and a 12V LED headlight powered from the 56V battery pack through a buck converter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, I used to ride this horrible thing to school nearly every day (except in winter, mostly). It has a top speed of a little over 20mph and a 16 mile range. Planned improvements include a less terrifyingly bendy chassis and perhaps some better brakes. I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a bike disc brake conversion kit and an adapter ring that should fit the hubmotor, so all that&amp;rsquo;s left is to modify the frame to enable mounting the calipers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 2017 - Sept 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project began when I picked up a sad typewriter with a broken keyboard set out for free in front of the university library. Since I have a soft spot for obsolete technology, I gave it a new home. Repurposing it became a recreational exercise in both hardware-microcontroller and microcontroller-computer interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images are broken down into lines of text by a Python script on a laptop, which then sends lines of ASCII via a serial-USB interface to an Arduino-style microcontroller. The microcontroller then emulates typewriter keypresses using the transistor array to switch the typewriterâ€™s keyboard matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping out the keyboard matrix was tedious, but the trickiest part was getting the computer and microcontroller to be patient. The microcontroller can switch the keyboard matrix much faster than the typewriter&amp;rsquo;s daisy wheel can spin, and the typewriter&amp;rsquo;s keyboard buffer only holds a few characters (presumably because fingers are usually slow). Without some way to make the system wait for the typewriter to finish typing, the typewriter tends to receive characters faster than it can type or remember them. I solved this problem by estimating an average typing time per character, and forcing the microcontroller to wait that interval before sending another character. Once the microcontroller has sent a complete line, it sends a message back to the Python script that it is ready to have its serial comms buffer filled with another line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Rasberry pi and webcam might be added eventually to integrate the whole system inside of the typewriter enclosure. This could be set up as a sort of photo-booth arrangement where one only has to push a button for a selfie to begin printing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to replicate this project, beware: you may find yourself searching for long-obsolete typewriter ribbons on ebay at 2 in the morning.
 Also beware: typewriters are always louder than you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 2017 - Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was for my Masters thesis at the University of Minnesota. The objective of this project was to develop a cheap and more rugged alternative to conventional water conductivity sensors, which are often susceptible to corrosion and fouling despite being quite expensive. This flaw exists because water conductivity is conventionally inferred by measuring the electrical resistivity of the water, which requires the direct contact of metallic electrodes with the water under test. I have avoided this problem in my design by measuring electrical impedance instead of electrical resistance. Thus, the sensor can use electrodes insulated from the water in an arrangement similar to a parallel-plate capacitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After coming up with the operating principle of the sensor, I designed, simulated, built, and characterized various prototypes. Prototypes were calibrated by comparison with a commercial conductivity sensor in saline solutions of various concentrations. The final prototype I presented at my thesis defense was paired with a commercial microcontroller/DDS board and was capable of processing the raw signal from the sensor and logging data in real units.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Scanmera</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;timeline&#34;&gt;Timeline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 2017 - Current&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project began as a just-for-fun repurposing of an obsolete scanner, but I soon discovered that the linear CCD in this scanner is very sensitive to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. This sensitivity, along with the high resolution of images produced by the Scanmera, means that I can potentially use it to measure the health of crops in fields by measuring the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is based on relative Red/IR reflectivity of plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how brightly vegetation shows up in the photos below. In the 4th picture, the weird vertical artifacts are actually passing pedestrians. Because the scanmera acquires images slowly from left to right, any moving objects get distorted along the horizontal axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scamera uses a 330mm doublet lens from an abandoned overhead projector. The scanner was heavily modified and none of the original optical assembly remains except for the imaging sensor. The sensor is so sensitive to IR that cardboard isnâ€™t sufficiently opaque, hence the need to line the enclosure with foil. The only way to control exposure and depth of field is by using laser-cut cardboard apertures because there is no shutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scanner likes to eat 16V, and due to lack of resources the current power supply is a horrible assembly consisting of a 16V switching power supply plugged into an automobile DC-AC converter which is hooked up to a 12V SLA battery salvaged from a dead UPS. One day I will use a 12V-16V boost converter like a normal person. For pseudo-portability, the whole thing is set up on a cart from IKEA. It&amp;rsquo;s juuuust short enough that I have to stoop when pushing it around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future work involves a chassis overhaul (for better portability), improved lightproofness (which should fix contrast issues), and a more stable/less noisy power supply (which should reduce the severe noise issue visible in pictures).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Dr. Pete Marchetto for making acquisition of the scanner possible, and thanks to Dane Kouttron for help troubleshooting the noise issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much life-debt was owed to Hanna Lin for standing out in sub-0 temperatures with me while I carted around a silly contraption.&lt;/p&gt;
