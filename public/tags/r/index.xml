      <description>Timeline Oct 2017
Project Description As an appreciator of both pretty pictures and ambitious radio projects, I wanted a real-time &amp;ldquo;Blue Marble&amp;rdquo;-style picture of the Earth as my deskop background.
My first attempt at making this happen was to try to receive the downlink from the GOES-16 geostationary weather satellite. GOES-16 is very far from the Earth, so a high-gain directional antenna is needed to listen in on it. Any reasonable person would have gotten a dish antenna, but given my time and budget constraints, I attempted to use an RTL-SDR with an inconveniently-sized corner reflector antenna built out of cardboard and foil, sized for the required gain at ~1600 Mhz.</description>
