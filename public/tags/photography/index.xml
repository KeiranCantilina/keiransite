      <description>Timeline Nov 2017 - Current
Project Description This project began as a just-for-fun repurposing of an obsolete scanner, but I soon discovered that the linear CCD in this scanner is very sensitive to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. This sensitivity, along with the high resolution of images produced by the Scanmera, means that I can potentially use it to measure the health of crops in fields by measuring the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is based on relative Red/IR reflectivity of plants.</description>
