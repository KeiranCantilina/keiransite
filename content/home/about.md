# About Me

I am currently a Senior Research Engineer at the Cleveland Clinic, where I am a member of the Automated Surgical Robotics research lab in the Biomedical Engineering department of the Lerner Research Institute. My research background focuses on finding solutions to engineering problems by drawing on interdisciplinary knowledge and resources. 

I've developed a toolbox of skills that has generalist characteristics by nature and specialist characteristics by education. My problem-solving style is a hybrid between the applied tactics of engineers (“Let's make something happen”) and the experimental methods of scientists (“Let's find out how this works”). My professional research spans a variety of topics in fields ranging from molecular biology through electrical engineering to robotics and software development. 

In my free time, I love to work on personal projects that make use of discarded electronics, broken appliances, and obsolete hardware. In the spirit of promoting upcycling, I enjoy the challenge of reusing and re-purposing materials with the smallest budget possible. This website serves as a portfolio for some of these side projects.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing the [carillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carillon), repairing manual typewriters, pickling, amateur radio, and building dangerously speedy electric scooters.
