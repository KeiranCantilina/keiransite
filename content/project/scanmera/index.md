# Project Description
This project began as a just-for-fun repurposing of an obsolete scanner, but I soon discovered that the linear CCD in this scanner is very sensitive to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. This sensitivity, along with the high resolution of images produced by the Scamera, means that I can potentially use it to measure the health of crops in fields by measuring the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is based on relative Red/IR reflectivity of plants. You can see how brightly vegetation shows up in the photos below.

The Scamera uses a 330mm doublet lens from an abandoned overhead projector. The modified imaging assembly is so sensitive to IR that cardboard isnâ€™t sufficiently opaque, hence the foil. The only way to control exposure and depth of field is by using laser-cut cardboard apertures because there is no shutter.

Future work involves a chassis overhaul (for better portability), improved lightproofness (which should fix contrast issues), and a more stable power supply (which should reduce the severe noise issue visible in pictures).

# Acknowledgements
 Thanks to Dr. Pete Marchetto for making acquisition of the scanner possible, and thanks to Dane Kouttron for help troubleshooting the noise issue.
 
 Much life-debt was owed to Hanna Lin for standing out in sub-0 temperatures with me while I carted around a silly contraption.
